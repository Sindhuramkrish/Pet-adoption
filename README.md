PET ADOPTION MANAGEMENT

The Pet Adoption System is a web-based mini project that 
facilitates the adoption of pets through a digital platform. It 
includes functionality for administrators to add pets, view adoption 
requests, and manage records. Users can view available pets and fill 
out a form to adopt them. The project demonstrates fundamental 
concepts of Database Management Systems (DBMS), including 
form creation, data insertion, retrieval, and login validation using 
PHP and MySQL.
